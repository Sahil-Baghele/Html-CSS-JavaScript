        Kanae Kocho  was a minor character in Demon 
        Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. She was a Demon Slayer and the late Flower Hashira 
        . She is the older sister of Shinobu Kocho and the
         adoptive older sister of Kanao Tsuyuri.

        She was slain several years prior to the present story by Upper Rank Two, Doma.
        Kanae is shown to be a good-natured girl with an easygoing personality; in 
        Shinobu and Kanao's flashbacks, 
        she is almost always seen with a gentle smile on her face.
