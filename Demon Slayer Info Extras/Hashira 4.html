        Giyu Tomioka is a major supporting character 
        of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. He is a Demon Slayer of the Demon 
        Slayer Corps and the current Water Hashira .
        Giyu always wears a stoic and unbothered expression on his face. However, he has 
        a reserved personality and a very strong sense of justice with no tolerance 
        towards those who don't know their own limitations and throw away their lives.
