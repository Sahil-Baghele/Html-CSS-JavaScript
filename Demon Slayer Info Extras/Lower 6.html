    <h1> Kamanue</h1>

    <img class="image" src="https://demonslayer.info/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Kamanue-768x960.jpg">

    <p> 
    
        Kamanue was a member of the Twelve Kizuki,
        having held the new position of Lower Rank Six.
        Kamanue was a very anxious and restive individual. He constantly wore a scared expression due to the fact that he felt weak and vulnerable as the lowest of the Lower Ranks. 
        He appeared to be constantly skittish during his short time at the Infinity Castle.
