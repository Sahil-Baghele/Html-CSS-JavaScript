        Rui was the primary antagonist in the Mount Natagumo Arc of Demon 
        Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. He was a demon affiliated with the Twelve Kizuki, holding the position of Lower Rank Five 
        .

        Rui was a quasi-calm, aloof and somewhat polite individual, rarely raising his 
        voice, and talking with everyone, demon or Demon Slayer, with a reasonable tone and vocabulary, though his low and guttural way of speaking seems to imply repressed anger and annoyance. Every time he spoke with Tanjiro Kamado during their 
        initial duel he remained somewhat civil in speech.
