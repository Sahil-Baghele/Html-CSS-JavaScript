        Kyojuro Rengoku was a major 
        supporting character of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba and a major character in the 
        Mugen Train Arc. He was a Demon Slayer 
        of the Demon Slayer Corps and the late Flame Hashira.
        Kyojuro was greatly enthusiastic in regard to his duties as a Hashira, and 
        often came across as cheerfully eccentric. He was amiable, pure of heart, 
        and boasted extraordinary 
        technique and swordsmanship stemming from strict practice and discipline.
