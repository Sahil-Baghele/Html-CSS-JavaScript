        Sabito was a former apprentice of Sakonji Urokodaki. 
        He appeared to assist Tanjiro Kamado in his preparations for the Final Selection 
        exam.
        Sabito was a serious young man who believed that all of his actions should be 
        becoming of a man. He was seen as a ruthless mentor during his time training Tanjiro
        Kamado, who was always quick to point out his flaws and refused to acknowledge him as
         a man. When asked about defeating the Hand Demon, Sabito appeared to have a 
         pessimistic view on conflicts, saying he believed 
        that no matter how hard someone tries it will never be enough to take the beast down.
