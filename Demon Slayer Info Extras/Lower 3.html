        Wakuraba was a member of the Twelve Kizuki, having 
        held the position of Lower Rank Three .
        Like most of the Lower Ranks, Wakuraba was very loyal to Muzan Kibutsuji. 
        When Muzan was brutally executing two of his fellow Lower Ranks, he was in 
        doubt that this would be his end, as he had hoped to become stronger for him.
