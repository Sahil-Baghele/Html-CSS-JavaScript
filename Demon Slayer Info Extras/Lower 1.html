        Enmu was the primary antagonist in the Mugen Train Arc of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. He was a demon affiliated with the Twelve Kizuki, holding the position of Lower Rank One 
        .

        Enmu was cold, callous, and sadistic, openly stating that he enjoyed the pain 
        and suffering of humans; his favorite method of torment was giving them a happy and 
        pleasant dream before turning it into a 
        nightmare and taking pleasure in the agonized expressions they made as he tortured 
        them.
