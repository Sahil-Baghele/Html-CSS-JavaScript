    <h1>Shinjuro Rengoku</h1>

        Shinjuro Rengoku is the father 
        of Kyojuro Rengoku and Senjuro Rengoku and the husband of Ruka Rengoku. He formerly 
        served as the Flame Hashira  of the Demon Slayer Corps.
        Shinjuro is a very short-tempered man, especially when regarding the Demon Slayer 
        Corps and his son, Kyojuro, with the mention of either causing him to grow furious. 
        He appears to be abusive, harshly insulting the recently deceased 
        Kyojuro and knocking Senjuro to the ground during his fight with Tanjiro.
