        Kagaya Ubuyashiki  is a major
         supporting character of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. He is the 97th leader 
         of the Demon Slayer Corps known mainly as Oyakata-sama.
        by his subordinates and peers and is also the head of the Ubuyashiki Family.
        Kagaya has a calm demeanor, showing genuine care about the members of the Demon 
        Slayers, considering them his children. He is also able to handle criticism well 
        and is honest about his weaknesses; 
        one being his inability to become a Demon Slayer despite being their main leader.
