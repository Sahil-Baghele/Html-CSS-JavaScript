    <h1>Muzan Kibutsuji</h1>

    <img class="image" src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp9210771.jpg">

    <p>
    
        Muzan Kibutsuji is the main antagonist of 
        Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. He is the Demon King, the first of his kind, and the progenitor of all other demons in existence. 

        A millennium ago during the Heian Era, Muzan was turned into a demon during an experimental treatment trying to cure his terminal illness, and his goal since then was to live without the fear of death and become truly eternal.
         He plans to accomplish this in two ways: finding the Blue Spider Lily 
        or creating more demons in hopes that one day, 
        one would be able to conquer his weakness of sunlight.
