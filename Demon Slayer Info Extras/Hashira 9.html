        Mitsuri Kanroji is a major supporting 
        character of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. She is a Demon Slayer 
        of the Demon Slayer Corps and 
        the current Love Hashira .
        Mitsuri is a very emotional, passionate, and jovial individual who constantly 
        compliments people in her head, likely a contributing factor towards her nickname as
         the Hashira of Love. 
        Although she can be shy and is easily flustered, Mitsuri is always kind to others.
