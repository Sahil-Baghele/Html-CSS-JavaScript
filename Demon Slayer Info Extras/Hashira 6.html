        Muichiro Tokito is a major supporting 
        character of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. He is a Demon Slayer of 
        the Demon Slayer Corps and the current Mist Hashira.
        Muichiro is an air-headed individual who seems to constantly wander off in thought
         and is unable to focus on anything. Impassive and, at times, obtuse, he tends to
          think only for himself and operates on logic alone, never 
        letting emotions guide him, making him seem seemingly apathetic and indifferent.
