    <h1>Kanao Tsuyuri</h1>

        Kanao Tsuyuri is a major supporting character of 
        Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. She is a Demon Slayer of the Demon 
        Slayer Corps, Shinobu Kocho's Tsuguko and the adopted sister of Shinobu and Kanae Kocho.
        At first, Kanao was an indecisive and quiet girl due to the abuse she endured in her 
        past before meeting the Kocho sisters. She became unable to make decisions by herself
         and repressed her emotions as a defense mechanism. In order to help rectify this, 
         Kanae 
        gave her a coin to flip to decide which path to follow when she didn't know what to do.
