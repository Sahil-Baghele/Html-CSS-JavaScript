        Jigoro Kuwajima  is the man who trained 
        Zenitsu Agatsuma and Kaigaku. He was formerly the Thunder Hashira 
         in the Demon Slayer Corps.
         Jigoro had a steadfast devotion to his students and strict training. Despite his 
         status as a strong mentor and experience as a previous Hashira, he had a soft spot 
         and unwavering dedication towards raising the next generation of students. Due to 
         this passionate devotion, he was filled with grief after discovering that his former 
         pupil, Kaigaku, 
         betrayed the Demon Slayer Corps and joined the ranks of the Twelve Kizuki.
