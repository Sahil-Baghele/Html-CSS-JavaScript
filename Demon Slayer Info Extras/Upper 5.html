    Gyokko, along with Hantengu, was one of the primary antagonists in the Swordsmith Village Arc of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. 
    He was a demon affiliated with the Twelve Kizuki, holding the position of Upper Rank Five.

Before becoming a demon, he was a human by the name of Managi.
Gyokko was shown to be an easily excitable demon, constantly fawning over new inspirations 
for what he deems his art or what he finds to be sublime, sometimes even going against his initial impressions.
