    <h1>Zenitsu Agatsuma</h1>

    <p>
    
        Zenitsu Agatsuma is one of the main characters of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba and along with Inosuke Hashibira, a travelling companion of Tanjiro Kamado and 
        Nezuko Kamado. He is also a Demon Slayer in the Demon Slayer Corps.
        In spite of his weaknesses, Zenitsu desires to live up to the 
        expectations others have set for him and will try his hardest when he needs to. He holds great respect and admiration towards his comrades and his deceased teacher, Jigoro Kuwajima, and his inner focus and drive in avenging him help to wash 
        away his cowardice and second thoughts when he is in a pinch.
