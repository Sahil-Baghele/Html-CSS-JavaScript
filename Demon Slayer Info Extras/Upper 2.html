        Doma  is a major supporting antagonist of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. He is a demon affiliated with the Twelve Kizuki, holding the second highest position, Upper Rank Two.

        Over a century ago, Doma held the position of Upper Rank Six, and during that tenure, he turned Gyutaro and Daki into demons and introduced them into the Twelve Kizuki.
        
        He is also the leader of the Eternal Paradise Faith, a cult dedicated to worshipping Doma and a place where he listens to all his followers' troubles and gives them advice. It also acts as a place for 
        Doma to capture and kill humans.
