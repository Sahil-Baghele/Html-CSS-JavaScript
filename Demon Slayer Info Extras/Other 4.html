        Yoriichi Tsugikuni is a major recurring character in Demon Slayer: 
        Kimetsu no Yaiba. He is a Demon Slayer who lived nearly 500 years ago during the 
        Sengoku era.[ He was the most powerful Demon Slayer to have ever existed.

        He is also the inventor of Breathing Styles, being the one who created the 
        first ever Breathing Style, Sun Breathing, that would eventually become the 
        Hinokami Kagura used by Tanjiro Kamado and members of the Kamado Family.
        
        Yoriichi is the younger twin brother of Michikatsu Tsugikuni, who later 
        became a demon and joined the Twelve Kizuki.
