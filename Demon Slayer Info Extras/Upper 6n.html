        Kaigaku  is a supporting antagonist in the Infinity Castle 
        Arc of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. He is a demon affiliated with the Twelve Kizuki, holding the position of Upper Rank Six , replacing Daki and Gyutaro after their deaths.

        Kaigaku was a former Demon Slayer and Zenitsu Agatsuma's senior disciple under 
        the former Thunder Hashira, Jigoro Kuwajima. However, sometime during Hashira Training, Kaigaku went on a mission and encountered Upper Rank One, Kokushibo, quickly surrendering to him to save his own skin
         and later becoming a member of the Twelve Kizuki.
