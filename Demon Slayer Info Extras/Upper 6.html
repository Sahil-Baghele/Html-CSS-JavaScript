        Gyutaro was one of the primary antagonists in the Entertainment District 
        Arc of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. He was a demon affiliated with the 
        Twelve Kizuki, holding the position of Upper Rank Six, a position he shared with 
        his younger sister, Daki.

        Over a century ago, Gyutaro was a human who worked as a debt collector in 
        the Rashomon Riverbank of Yoshiwara,the lowest class in the Entertainment 
        District, before he and Daki were turned into demons personally by Doma, who was Upper Rank Six at the time.
